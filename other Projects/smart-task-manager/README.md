# Smart Task Manager (JavaScript DOM Project)

A **pure JavaScript DOM-based task management application** built to demonstrate **core and advanced DOM concepts** without using any frameworks or libraries.

This project is designed as a **learning reference** for understanding how JavaScript directly manipulates the DOM to create interactive web applications.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Task Manager** allows users to:

* Add tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Delete tasks
* Filter tasks (All / Pending / Completed)

All functionality is implemented using **vanilla JavaScript** and the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was created to:

* Practice **JavaScript DOM manipulation**
* Understand **event handling and event delegation**
* Learn how dynamic UIs work **without frameworks**
* Build a real-world use case using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

---

## 🧠 DOM Concepts Covered

This project uses **all fundamental and intermediate DOM concepts**, including:

* DOM Tree structure
* `document` object
* Element selection (`getElementById`, attributes)
* Creating and removing elements
* Updating content using `innerHTML`
* Class manipulation with `classList`
* Event handling (`click`, `submit`)
* Event object (`event.target`)
* Event delegation
* DOM traversal (`children`, `closest`)
* Form handling and `preventDefault`
* Conditional rendering
* Safe DOM loading (`DOMContentLoaded`)

├── index.html   # HTML structure (DOM tree)

├── script.js    # JavaScript DOM logic
└── README.md    # Project documentation
```

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Page structure
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation and logic

No external libraries or frameworks are used.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:

   * `index.html`
   * `style.css`
   * `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser

No server or installation is required.

---

## 🧪 How the App Works (High Level)

1. User enters a task and submits the form
2. JavaScript dynamically creates a task element
3. Tasks are added to the DOM using `appendChild`
4. Click events are handled using **event delegation**
5. CSS classes are toggled to mark tasks as completed
6. Filters show/hide tasks based on their state

---

## 🚀 Possible Enhancements

This project can be extended with:

* Edit task functionality
* Task persistence using `localStorage`
* Dark mode toggle
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Conversion to React (Virtual DOM comparison)

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome

By completing and understanding this project, you will be able to:

* Confidently manipulate the DOM using JavaScript
* Build interactive UI features without frameworks
* Understand how frameworks like React manage UI internally
* Debug and structure real-world JavaScript projects
